[id="permissions-cluster-administrator"]
= Permissions of {PRODUCT_SHORT} {cluster-administrator}s

Typically, a {cluster-administrator} uses the OpenShift CLI tools on a local machine to interact with a  {PRODUCT} cluster.
The client is available from the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=4.3/rhel---8/4.3.5/x86_64/product-software[download] page.

A {cluster-administrator} can:

* Manage the OpenShift cluster as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/administering_a_cluster/index[Administering a cluster]
* Create another {cluster-administrator}
* Manage 3scale and give a {cluster-developer} admin rights in 3scale
* Administer the {customer-sso-name} and give a {cluster-developer} administration privileges on the master realm
* Manage any realms created by a {cluster-developer}
* View the managed services projects in the OpenShift console


NOTE: Do not delete the `admin` user in the master realm of the {customer-sso-name}. Red Hat manages this service using this user.

[id="configuring-github-oauth-for-codeready-workspaces_{context}"]
= Configuring GitHub OAuth for CodeReady Workspaces

{PRODUCT} provides a full developer workspace server and cloud IDE with {code-ready-short}, allowing you to pull and push to GitHub projects. You must configure a GitHub OAuth app before {cluster-developer}s can pull and push GitHub projects.
The GitHub OAuth app allows users to import projects into {code-ready-short} by using SSH addresses (`git@`). Users can then push to repositories and use the pull request panel.

This procedure enables automatic SSH key upload to GitHub.

.Prerequisites

* You must have prior experience using GitHub.
* You are a {cluster-administrator}.

.Procedure

. Register an application on GitHub:
**  To add a new application, log in to GitHub and go to OAuth applications in your developer settings. Click https://github.com/settings/profile[Settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/apps[Developer settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/developers[OAuth Apps] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application].
** For GitHub Enterprise, go to your GitHub Enterprise homepage and then click
*Settings -> Developer settings -> Register a new application*.
. Enter an application name, for example, `CodeReady Workspaces`.
. For the homepage URL, enter the CodeReady Workspaces URL.
+
[subs="attributes"]

[id="configuring-amq-online-for-production"]
= Configuring AMQ Online for production

If you plan to use AMQ Online in {PRODUCT_SHORT}, you need to create an AMQ Online configuration for production.
You must edit and apply YAML files using the command line (CLI) tools to configure AMQ Online.

This section provides general guidance on configuring AMQ Online for production usage in {PRODUCT_SHORT}.

.Prerequisites
* You are a {cluster-administrator}.
* Experience with configuring AMQ Online.

.Procedure

. Configure AMQ Online in {PRODUCT_SHORT} as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html-single/installing_and_managing_amq_online_on_openshift/index#configuring-messaging[Configuring AMQ Online].
+
* You must log in as a {cluster-administrator}.
//(for RHMI1) The name of the AMQ Online project in your cluster is enmasse
+
* The name of the AMQ Online project in your cluster is `redhat-rhmi-amq-online`.

. Configure your address space to use an external authentication service as shown in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html-single/using_amq_online_on_openshift/index#ref-address-space-example-external-auth-service-override-messaging[address space example using an external authentication service].
+
NOTE: The authentication services are configured by the AMQ Online service operator and are specified when creating an address space.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// as_admin-guide.adoc


// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="network-policies_{context}"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Network policies

A {PRODUCT_SHORT} cluster hosts two types of projects:

* Projects associated with managed services, for example, the `redhat-rhmi-amq-online` project is associated with AMQ Online. These projects support inbound and outbound connections.
* User projects, for example a web app. These projects support communication from the managed services mentioned above.
If you want to disable that communication, see xref:disabling-communications_admin-guide[].

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/networking/index[Networking] documentation for an introduction to OpenShift Dedicated networking.


In OpenShift, there are two approaches to enabling communications:

* Using network policies
* Using the `join-project` option of the `oc` command

In {PRODUCT_SHORT}, you can enable communications using network policies.
You cannot use the `join-projects` option of the `oc` command with managed services projects.

[id="enabling-communications_{context}"]
= Enabling communication between projects in your cluster

By default, when you create projects in a cluster, communication between the projects is disabled.

This procedure describes enabling communication for a project.

.Prerequisite

* You are a {cluster-administrator}.

.Procedure

. Log in to the cluster using the `oc` login command.

. Change project:
+
----
$ oc project <project_name>
----
+
where `<project_name>` is the name of a project that you want to accept communications from other projects.

. Create a NetworkPolicy object as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/networking/index#nw-networkpolicy-create_configuring-networkpolicy-plugin[Creating a NetworkPolicy object] with the following content:
+
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-all
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - {}
----
+
NOTE: This policy configuration enables this project to communicate with all projects in the cluster.

[id="disabling-communications_{context}"]
= Disabling communication from a managed service to your project

By default, your projects are created with a template that allows communication from a managed service.
For example, {three-scale-name} can communicate with all your projects by default.
This procedure describes disabling that communication.

.Prerequisites

* A project you want to isolate from the managed services
* You are a {cluster-administrator}.

.Procedure

. Log in to the cluster using the `oc` login command.

. Change project:
+
----
$ oc project <project_name>
----
+
where `<project_name>` is the name of a project that you want to isolate from the managed services.


. Create a NetworkPolicy object as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html-single/networking/index#nw-networkpolicy-create_configuring-networkpolicy-plugin[Creating a NetworkPolicy object] with the following content:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-all
spec:
  podSelector: redhat-rhmi-*
  ingress:
  - {}
----
+
NOTE: This disables communication from all projects, not just the managed services.

[id="disabling-realm-creation_{context}"]
= Disabling realm creation for {cluster-developer}s

By default, a {cluster-developer} can create a realm in the {customer-sso-name}.
This section describes how to disable this permission. You might want to disable this permission in a production cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You are a {cluster-administrator}.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {webapp}.

. Open the {customer-sso-name} console.

. When prompted, choose the *Administration Console*.

. Choose *Groups* from the menu for the Master realm.

. Select the *rhmi-developers* group.

. Click *Edit* from the *User Groups* menu.

. Choose the *Role Mappings* tab.

. Select *create-realm* in the *Assigned Roles* panel.

. Click *Remove selected* to remove that role from the *rhmi-developers* group.

. To verify the change, log into the {customer-sso-name} as a {cluster-developer} and make sure you cannot create a realm.

[id='manage-3scale-users_{context}']

= 3scale user management

Red Hat 3scale API Management allows you to manage APIs for internal or external users.

User management with 3scale in {PRODUCT_SHORT} can be summarized as follows:

* All users with access to the cluster can log in to 3scale API Management.
* All {cluster-administrator}s have administrator privileges in 3scale.
* Only a {cluster-administrator} can create new products.
* Only a {cluster-administrator} can grant 3scale administrator privileges to any cluster user.


[NOTE]
====
The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/{three-scale-version}/html/admin_portal_guide/index[Portal Admin Guide] describes how to administer users in 3scale. However, you cannot delete a user from 3scale in {PRODUCT_SHORT}. You must revoke the cluster privileges of that user. If a user is removed from the cluster, the user is also removed from 3scale.
