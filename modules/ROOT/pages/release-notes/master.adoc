[id="new-changed"]
= Key features

{PRODUCT} is a platform for developing and deploying enterprise integration solutions.
It is hosted and managed by Red Hat so you can focus on building applications, not infrastructure.
{PRODUCT_SHORT} enables your team to develop, build, and deploy enterprise integration solutions on an OpenShift Dedicated cluster managed by Red Hat

*Services:* Integration capabilities and services which are fully hosted and managed integration components that are pre-installed and pre-configured on an OpenShift Dedicated cluster. The products available as services are:

* API management ({three-scale-name})
* Enterprise connectivity ({fuse-short-name})
* Messaging ({amq-online-name})
* Single sign-on ({rhsso-name})
* Integrated development environment ({code-ready-name})

*Solution Patterns:* Pre-developed Solution Patterns demonstrate best practices and help development teams get started quickly. You can create additional Solution Patterns to standardize best practices.

*Solution Explorer:* A unified front-end web application that provides access to the installed products, development tools, Solution Patterns, and the Red Hat OpenShift console.

Technical preview features are not enabled by default in {PRODUCT} clusters. For example, the Internet of Things (IoT) feature of AMQ Online is not enabled. Any exceptions are labeled in the Solution Explorer.

[id="known-issues"]
= Known issues

This section lists known issues with Red Hat Managed Integration 2.1.0:

* There is an intermittent issue where the user is redirected to the login page when logging into the {unifiedpush-service} or {fuse-name}. To workaround this issue, clear the cookies in your browser.
* Service Discovery as described in the link:{three-scale-service-discovery}[3scale documentation] does not work in RHMI 2.1.
For example, you cannot successfully complete the _4 - Protecting APIs using 3scale API Management Platform_ Solution Pattern.
* If you log into the OpenShift console as a {cluster-developer} and then switch to the Developer perspective, you get a "Restricted Access" error. To workaround this issue, select a project from the project drop-down menu.
* There is an intermittent issue where logging out of the {webapp} allows the user to log back in again without requiring login credentials.
* If user emails are not available as part of your IdP configuration, you cannot receive 3scale email notifications.
To workaround this issue, each user must:
1. Log in to 3scale from the {webapp}.
2. Access the *Settings* menu by clicking the gear icon.
3. Enter your email address in the *USER INFORMATION* section.
4. Click *Update Details*.
