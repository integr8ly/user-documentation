= Enabling service discovery in 3scale

By default, a {PRODUCT_SHORT} user cannot perform service discovery in 3scale.

To enable service discovery of APIs created in the shared Fuse Online instance:

. Log in to OpenShift as the `customer-admin` user from the command line.

. Enter the following command to enable the `<username>` user perform service discovery of Fuse Online APIs:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view <user-name> -n fuse 
----
