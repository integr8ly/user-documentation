= Access to queues from upgraded AMQ Online Console
As part of the upgrade of Managed Integration from 1.3 to 1.4, AMQ Online is upgraded from 1.0 to 1.1.

Any existing queues continue to work; however, the AMQ Online Console links for these queues will fail.

If you created queues and require access to those queues from the AMQ Online Console, perform the following steps for each queue affected:

NOTE: If you created a queue using a {walkthrough-name}, performing the {walkthrough-name} again will create a new queue and you are not required to perform these steps.


.Procedure

. Create a new queue, for example, using the *Integrating message-oriented middleware with a RESTful API* {walkthrough-name}.
. Get a new URL, username and password as described in Task 2 of the {walkthrough-name}.
. Update your integration to connect to the new queue as described in Task 3 of the {walkthrough-name}. Update any applications if required.

After completing this procedure, delete any unused queues to save resources.
