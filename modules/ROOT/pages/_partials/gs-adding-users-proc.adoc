[[customer-admin]]
= About the customer-admin user

You access your cluster using the credentials for the `customer-admin` user received in the _Welcome_ email. This user can:

* access the OpenShift cluser with the permissions of the link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/3/admin_guide/index.html#admin-guide-index-dedicated-admin-role[Dedicated cluster administrator Role], including read-only access to the Fuse Online project.
* access the services available from the Solution Explorer with administrator privileges, for example:

** 3scale admin access, that is,  full access to all areas and services.

** the `customer-admin` user has the manage-user, view-realm and manage-identity-providers roles in the managed integration SSO instance as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/server_administration_guide/admin_permissions#realm_specific_roles[Red Hat Single Sign-On documentation]

See the link:{rn-link}[Release Notes] for links to the associated product documentation.

NOTE: The `customer-admin` user is a single account with the privilege to create users in your Managed Integration cluster. If you require additional users with `customer-admin` user privileges, contact link:https://access.redhat.com/support[Red Hat Support].




[[sso]]
= About Single Sign-On instances

:rhmi-sso-name: Managed Integration SSO instance
:customer-sso-name: End user SSO instance
:rhsso-name: 



.The two SSO instances in {PRODUCT_SHORT}
|===
| |*{rhmi-sso-name}* |*{customer-sso-name}*

|Usage
|Create the users of the cluster applications accessible from {webapp}, typically developers and integration engineers.

Red Hat manages and provides limited access to this instance. For example, you can implement user federation with this instance, but you cannot create a realm.

|Define the identities of the end users of the solution developed and hosted on {PRODUCT_SHORT}.

Red Hat manages this instance, however the customer-admin user has admin level privileges to configure this instance.


|Solution Explorer link
|Red Hat Single Sign-On (Cluster)
|Red Hat Single Sign-On

When you click this link the first time an *Account already exists* message and an *Add to existing account* option are displayed. 

Choose this option. After logging in as the `customer-admin`, you will have administrator access.
Subsequent logins do not require this step.

|User access
|`customer-admin`
|`customer-admin`

A user named `admin` is also created and is used to manage this instance. Do not delete this user.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you define users of the solution you are developing in the *{customer-sso-name}*.
For example, if you use {PRODUCT_SHORT} to develop an solution named `my-app`, define all users of `my-app` in the *{customer-sso-name}* instance only.

Typically, you only use the *{customer-sso-name}* for end users; however, you have the privileges required to use it for developer related activities.
// tag::excludeDownstream[]
For example, if a developer wanted to use http://microcks.github.io/[Microcks],that developer could create associated users in this instance.
// end::excludeDownstream[]

[[managing-users]]
= Managing Users in the {rhmi-sso-name}

You manage users in the context of a Red Hat Single Sign-On realm (RHSSO).
A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.
A user belongs to a realm and can log in to this realm.

NOTE: You should federate an LDAP or Active Directory server in each Red Hat Single Sign-On realm as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html-single/server_administration_guide/index#user-storage-federation[User Storage Federation documentation], to avoid managing the same users in different realms.

[NOTE]
====
You can also import a JSON file with user information as described in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.2/html/server_administration_guide/export_import#admin_console_export_import[Red Hat Single Sign-On documentation].

== Managing Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform users

A user created in Red Hat Single Sign-On can log in to the 3scale console; however, the user's account is only created in 3scale after that initial login. The new user is assigned the role `member` and by default does not have permissions set. The user role and permission can only be set once a user account is created in 3scale.

To ensure you create users with the correct roles for Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform:

. Create a user using the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.
. Ensure the user logs in to the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform console.
. Log in to the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console and assign roles to the user.


=== Accessing the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

To access the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console:

. Navigate to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* URL that you received in the _Welcome email_.
If asked for credentials, log in as the `customer-admin` user.

. Click the *Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform* link available in the *Applications* panel.


=== Setting user roles and permissions in Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

.Prerequisite
* You have logged in to the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console using the *Authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On* facility.

NOTE: All users in 3scale are created as a `member` with no permissions set by default.


.Procedure 
To change permissions for a 3scale user:

. Navigate to *Account Settings* by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the 3scale console.
+

. Select *Listings* from the *Users* menu. A list of users is displayed.

. Find the user you want to change, and click on the *Edit* button for that user.

. On the *Edit User* page, change the user's roles and permissions:
+

+
For example, you can give the user the *Admin* role.

. Click the *Update User* button to save your changes.

=== Deleting users in the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

.Prerequisite
* You have logged in to the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console using the *Authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On* facility.


.Procedure
To delete 3scale users:

. Navigate to *Account Settings*.

. Go to *Users* > *Listings*.
. Find the user you wish to delete.
. Click the *Delete* button associated with that user.

== Giving users permissions to view integration logs and perform 3scale service discovery

This procedure describes how to add the *view* role for a user if that user requires either of the following:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.4/html-single/service_discovery/index[Service Discovery] in 3scale, which can be used to add Fuse Online services automatically
* Access to Fuse Online integration logs

. Log in to OpenShift using `oc` and the `customer-admin` credentials.
. Run the following command, where `<userid>` is the user you want to give the role to:
+
----
oc adm policy add-role-to-user view <userid> -n openshift-fuse
----
