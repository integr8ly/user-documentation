[[customer-admin]]
= About the customer-admin user

You access your cluster using the credentials for the `customer-admin` user received in the _Welcome_ email. This user can:

* access the OpenShift cluster with the permissions of the link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/3/admin_guide/index.html#admin-guide-index-dedicated-admin-role[Dedicated cluster administrator Role], including read-only access to the Fuse Online project.
* access the services available from the Solution Explorer with administrator privileges, for example:

** 3scale admin access, that is,  full access to all areas and services.

** the `customer-admin` user has the manage-user, view-realm and manage-identity-providers roles in the managed integration SSO instance as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/server_administration_guide/admin_permissions#realm_specific_roles[Red Hat Single Sign-On documentation]

See the link:{rn-link}[Release Notes] for links to the associated product documentation.

NOTE: The `customer-admin` user is a single account with the privilege to create users in your Managed Integration cluster. If you require additional users with `customer-admin` user privileges, contact link:https://access.redhat.com/support[Red Hat Support].




[[sso]]
= About Single Sign-On instances

.The two SSO instances in {PRODUCT_SHORT}
|===
| |*{rhmi-sso-name}* |*{customer-sso-name}*

|Usage
|Create the users of the cluster applications accessible from {webapp}, typically developers and integration engineers.

Red Hat manages and provides limited access to this instance. For example, you can implement user federation with this instance, but you cannot create a realm.

|Define the identities of the end users of the solution developed and hosted on {PRODUCT_SHORT}.

Red Hat manages this instance, however the customer-admin user has admin level privileges to configure this instance.


|Solution Explorer link
|Red Hat Single Sign-On (Cluster)
|Red Hat Single Sign-On

When you click this link the first time an *Account already exists* message and an *Add to existing account* option are displayed. 

Choose this option. After logging in as the `customer-admin`, you will have administrator access.
Subsequent logins do not require this step.

|User access
|`customer-admin`
|`customer-admin`

A user named `admin` is also created and is used to manage this instance. Do not delete this user.

| Permissions
| Can create users in the `openshift` realm.

Can add an Identity Provider in the `openshift` realm as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/server_administration_guide/identity_broker[Identity Brokering] to avoid managing the same users in different realms.

| Can create users in the `master` realm.

Can add an Identity Provider in the `master` realm as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/server_administration_guide/identity_broker[Identity Brokering] to avoid managing the same users in different realms.

Can create new and manage realms.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you define users of the solution you are developing in the *{customer-sso-name}*.
For example, if you use {PRODUCT_SHORT} to develop an solution named `my-app`, define all users of `my-app` in the *{customer-sso-name}* instance only.

Typically, you only use the *{customer-sso-name}* for end users; however, you have the privileges required to use it for developer related activities.
// tag::excludeDownstream[]
For example, if a developer wanted to use http://microcks.github.io/[Microcks], that developer could create associated users in this instance.
// end::excludeDownstream[]
====


[[managing-users]]
= Managing Users in the {rhmi-sso-name}

You manage users in the context of a Red Hat Single Sign-On realm.
A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.
A user belongs to a realm and can log in to this realm.

NOTE: Red Hat recommends setting up an identity provider in each Red Hat Single Sign-On realm as described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.3/html/server_administration_guide/identity_broker[Identity Brokering documentation]. For example, set up Active Directory as an OIDC provider to avoid managing the same users in different realms.

== Managing Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform users

A user created in Red Hat Single Sign-On can log in to the 3scale console; however, the user's account is only created in 3scale after that initial login. The new user is assigned the role `member` and by default does not have permissions set. The user role and permission can only be set once a user account is created in 3scale.

To ensure you create users with the correct roles for Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform:

. Create a user using the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.
. Ensure the user logs in to the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform console.
. Log in to the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console and assign roles to the user.


=== Accessing the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

To access the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console:

. Navigate to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* URL that you received in the _Welcome email_.
If asked for credentials, log in as the `customer-admin` user.

. Click the *Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform* link available in the *Applications* panel.


=== Setting user roles and permissions in Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

.Prerequisite
* You have logged in to the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console using the *Authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On* facility.

NOTE: All users in 3scale are created as a `member` with no permissions set by default.


.Procedure 
To change permissions for a 3scale user:

. Navigate to *Account Settings* by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the 3scale console.
