:rhmi-sso-name: Managed Integration SSO instance
:customer-sso-name: End user SSO instance
:rhsso-name: 



.The two SSO instances in {PRODUCT_SHORT}
|===
| |*{rhmi-sso-name}* |*{customer-sso-name}*

|Usage
|Define the identities of the integration engineers and developers logging into the Red Hat applications available from the Solution Explorer.

Red Hat manages and provides limited access to this instance, for example, you can implement user federation with this instance, but you cannot create a realm.

|Define the identities of the end users of the solution developed and hosted on {PRODUCT_SHORT}.

Red Hat manages this instance, however the customer-admin user has admin level privileges to configure this instance.


|Solution Explorer link
|Red Hat Single Sign-On (Cluster)
|Red Hat Single Sign-On

When you click this link the first time a *Account already exists* message is displayed, and an *Add to existing account* option is displayed. 

Choose this option and after logging in as `customer-admin` you have administrator access.
Subsequent logins do not require this step.

|User access
|`customer-admin`
|`customer-admin`

A user named `admin` is also created and is used to manage this instance. Do not delete this user.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you define users of the solution you are developing in the *{customer-sso-name}*.
For example, if you use {PRODUCT_SHORT} to develop an solution named `my-app`, define all users of `my-app` in the *{customer-sso-name}* instance only.

Typically, you only use the *{customer-sso-name}* for end users, however you have the required privileges to use it for developer related activities.
// tag::excludeDownstream[]
For example, if a developer wanted to use http://microcks.github.io/[Microcks], that developer could create associated users in this instance.
// end::excludeDownstream[]

== Managing Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform users

Users created in  Red Hat Single Sign-On can login to the 3scale console, however the user's account is created in 3scale after that initial login. The new user is assigned the role `member` and no permissions set by default. The user role and permission can only be set once a user account is created in 3scale.

To make sure you create users with the correct roles for Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform:

. Create the user using Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.
. Make sure that user logs into the  Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform console.
. Log into the  Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console and assign the roles to that user.


=== Accessing the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

To access the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console:

. Navigate to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* URL that you received in the *Welcome* email.
If asked for credentials, login as the `customer-admin` user.

. Click the *Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform* link available in the *Applications* panel.


=== Setting user roles and permissions in Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

.Prerequisite

* You have logged into the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console using the 'Authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On' facility.

NOTE: All users in 3scale are created as a `member` with no permissions set by default.

To change permissions for a 3scale user:

. Navigate to *Account Settings* by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the 3scale console.
