= Adding verifications to a {PRODUCT} Solution Pattern
Verifications are interactive elements in a Solution Pattern that confirm whether a user has successfully completed a procedure. They are questions presented to the user, which can be answered with either a `Yes` or `No` response.

NOTE: Every procedure in a task or subtask requires a verification.


.Prerequisites
* You have created a repository using the Solution Pattern template.
* You have added the Solution Pattern repository to your cluster as described in xref:gs-publishing-walkthroughs-proc[Adding Solution Patterns].


.Procedure
To add a verification:

. Edit the `walkthroughs/1-template-walkthrough/walkthrough.adoc` file.

. At the end of the procedure section, following the numbered list add:
+

----
[type={verificationText}]
Check that the dashboard of service X reports no errors.
----
. Add the following block to cater for users that answer the question with `No`:
+

[type=verificationFail]
Try turning it off and on again.
