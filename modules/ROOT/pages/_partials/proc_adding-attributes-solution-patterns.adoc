== Adding attributes to a {PRODUCT} {walkthrough-name}

Attributes are used to make external variable users performing a {walkthrough-name}.
The syntax for using attributes is `{<attribute name>}`. {walkthrough-name}s have access to a number of predefined attributes:

* If a middleware service defines a route you can access it using `{route-<route name>-host}`.

* The OpenShift console is available as `\{openshift-host}`.

Other attributes that are available to {walkthrough-name} authors are:

* Default attributes:
** OpenShift App Host: `\{openshift-app-host}`
** CodeReady Workspaces URL: `\{che-url}`.
** Fuse URL: `\{fuse-url}`
** Launcher URL: `\{launcher-url}`
** API Management URL: `\{api-management-url}`
** AMQ Online URL: `\{enmasse-url}`
** AMQ Online Broker URL: `\{enmasse-broker-url}`
** AMQ Online Credential Username: `\{enmasse-credentials-username}`
** AMQ Online Credential Password: `\{enmasse-credentials-password}`
