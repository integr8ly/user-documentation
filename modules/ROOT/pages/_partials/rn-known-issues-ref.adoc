// https://issues.redhat.com/browse/INTLY-9939
* In *Managed Integration SSO* and *Single sign-on*, changing the email address of an administrator account in the *Manage account* settings window produces an error.
+
To work around this issue:

. Log in to the {webapp} as a `customer-admin` user.

. Click the *Single Sign-On* link on the *All Services* tab.

. Click *Administration Console*.

. Select the realm that contains the user account whose details you want to modify.

. Select *users* from the sidebar.

. Click *View all users*.

. Find the user account that you want to change the email details of and click *Edit*.

. Add the email details and click *Save*.

// https://issues.redhat.com/browse/INTLY-7399
* In {amq-online-name-short}, messages may not be distributed evenly among multiple consumers. This happens when:
** Consumers are slow (taking 10-12 minutes to process each message).
** Each slow consumer has a prefetch value of zero.

// This is https://issues.redhat.com/browse/INTLY-7031
* The *Low-code API development and SaaS integration* Solution Pattern is not available in this release.

// https://issues.redhat.com/browse/INTLY-6478
* In the *Managing and protecting APIs using API management* Solution Pattern, you must have administrator privileges to create a product in 3scale. You do not require administrator privileges for other Solution Patterns.

* The `customer-admin` user cannot prevent users with access to the {webapp} from changing the {walkthrough-name} subscription settings. Any user with access to the {webapp} can determine which {walkthrough-name}s are available in a cluster.

* In this version of {PRODUCT_SHORT}, your {customer-sso-name} is upgraded to Red Hat Single Sign-On {rhsso-version}.
+ 
Applications that use {customer-sso-name}s will continue to function.
We recommend you upgrade the SSO connectors in your applications to use the latest version.
