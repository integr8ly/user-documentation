= Managing Users

You manage users in the context of an Red Hat Single Sign-On realm. 
A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.  
A user belongs to and logs into a realm.  
Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

// removed realm as per https://issues.jboss.org/browse/INTLY-2168
// https://gist.github.com/finp/ac8b7a743917b2b8268f28e73797e861
