= About Single Sign-On instances

:rhmi-sso-name: Managed Integration RH-SSO instance
:customer-sso-name: End user RH-SSO instance

{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides two RH-SSO instances:

* *{rhmi-sso-name}*
+
Use the *{rhmi-sso-name}* instance to define the identities of the integration engineers and developers logging into the Red Hat applications available from the Solution Explorer.
+
Red Hat manages and provides limited access to this instance, for example, you can implement user federation with this instance, but you cannot create a realm.
+
See xref:managing-users[Managing Users] and xref:gs-adding-custom-idp[Adding custom identity providers] sections for more information on using this instance.

* *{customer-sso-name}*
+
Use the *{customer-sso-name}* instance to define the identities of the end users of the solution developed and hosted on {PRODUCT_SHORT}.
+
Red Hat manages this instance, however the customer-admin user has admin level privileges to configure this instance.
+
See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on[Product Documentation for Red Hat Single Sign-On] for more information on using Red Hat Single Sign-On.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you define users of the solution you are developing in the *{customer-sso-name}*.
For example, if you use {PRODUCT_SHORT} to develop an solution named `my-app`, define all users of `my-app` in the *{customer-sso-name}* instance only.

Typically, you only use the *{customer-sso-name}* for end users, however you have the required privileges to use it for developer related activities.
// tag::excludeDownstream[]
For example, if a developer wanted to use http://microcks.github.io/[Microcks], that developer could create associated users in this instance.
// end::excludeDownstream[]

[[managing-users]]
= Managing Users in the {rhmi-sso-name}

You manage users in the context of an Red Hat Single Sign-On realm.
A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.
A user belongs to and logs into a realm.

=== Accessing the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console

. Navigate to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* URL that you received in the *Welcome* email.
If asked for credentials, login as the `customer-admin` user.

. Click the *Red Hat Single Sign-On* link available in the *Applications* panel.


== Viewing Users in the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console

.Prerequisite

* You have logged into the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.


To view user list:

. Navigate to the *Users* menu. The search box at the top of the page can be used to query the list and only show users that matches your criteria.
. Click the *View all users* button at the top of the page. This displays the list of users currently available in the {PRODUCT_SHORT} environment.

== Creating users in the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console

.Prerequisite

* You have logged into the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.

To create a user:

. Navigate to the *Users* menu.
. Click the *Add User* button at the top right corner of the page.
. Enter the user information:
+
 * Enter values to `Username` and `Email`.
 * Set `User Enabled` to *ON*.
 * Set `Email Verified` to *ON*. This ensures that the user account will be activated in 3scale.

- Click the *Save* button to create the user.

NOTE: You can also import a JSON file with user information as described in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.2/html/server_administration_guide/export_import#admin_console_export_import[RHSSO documentation].

The following example JSON file imports two users:

[source,javascript]
----
{ "users": [
    {
      "username": "jdoe",
      "enabled": true,
      "emailVerified": true,
      "email": "johndoe@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "realmRoles": ["offline_access", "uma_authorization"],
      "clientRoles": {
          "account": ["manage-account", "view-profile"]
      },
      "groups": [],
      "attributes": {},
      "credentials": [{
        "type" : "password",

      "groups": [],
      "attributes": {},
      "credentials": [{
        "type" : "password",
        "value" : "Password1"
      }]
    }
  ]
}

== Managing Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform users

Users created in  Red Hat Single Sign-On can login to the 3scale console, however the user's account is created in 3scale after that initial login. The new user is assigned the role `member` and no permissions set by default. The user role and permission can only be set once a user account is created in 3scale.

To make sure you create users with the correct roles for Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform:

. Create the user using Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.
. Make sure that user logs into the  Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform console.
. Log into the  Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console and assign the roles to that user.


=== Accessing the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

To access the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console:

. Navigate to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* URL that you received in the *Welcome* email.
If asked for credentials, login as the `customer-admin` user.

. Click the *Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform* link available in the *Applications* panel.


=== Setting user roles and permissions in Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

.Prerequisite

* You have logged into the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console using the 'Authenticate through Red Hat Single Sign-On' facility.

NOTE: All users in 3scale are created as a `member` with no permissions set by default.

To change permissions for a 3scale user:

. Navigate to *Account Settings* by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the 3scale console.
