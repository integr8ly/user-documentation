= Managing Users

You manage users in the context of an Red Hat Single Sign-On realm. A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.  A user belongs to and logs into a realm.  Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides two realms for user management:

* `openshift` - users who develop solutions using the Red Hat applications available from the Solution Explorer
* `{customer-realm-name}` - end users of the solutions developed by the users in the `openshift` realm

NOTE: Red Hat recommends that you define users of the solution you are developing in the `{customer-realm-name}` realm. For example, if you use {PRODUCT_SHORT} to develop an solution named `my-app`, define all users of `my-app` in the `{customer-realm-name}` realm only.


== Accessing the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console

To access the administration console navigate to the following URL, replacing `<cluster-host>` with the hostname of your cluster:

----
https://sso-sso.<cluster-host>/auth/admin/openshift/console
----

Log in as the `customer-admin` user using the credentials that you received in the *Welcome* email.


== Viewing Users in the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console

.Prerequisites

* You have logged into the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.
* You have selected the correct realm from the top left menu of realms, `openshift` for developers, `{customer-realm-name}` for solution end users.


To view user list:

. Navigate to the *Users* menu. The search box at the top of the page can be used to query the list and only show users that matches your criteria.
. Click the *View all users* button at the top of the page. This displays the list of users currently available in the {PRODUCT_SHORT} environment.

== Creating users in the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console

.Prerequisites

* You have logged into the Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.
* You have selected the correct realm from the top left menu of realms, `openshift` for developers, `{customer-realm-name}` for solution end users.

To create a user:

. Navigate to the *Users* menu.

- Click the *Save* button to create the user.

NOTE: You can also import a JSON file with user information as described in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.2/html/server_administration_guide/export_import#admin_console_export_import[RHSSO documentation].

The following example JSON file imports two users:

[source,javascript]

      "realmRoles": ["offline_access", "uma_authorization"],
      "clientRoles": {
          "account": ["manage-account", "view-profile"]
      },
      "groups": [],
      "attributes": {},
      "credentials": [{
        "type" : "password",

        "value" : "Password1"
      }]
    }
  ]
}

== Managing Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform users

Users created in  Red Hat Single Sign-On can login to the 3Scale console, however the user's account is created in 3Scale after that initial login. The new user is assigned the role `member` and no permissions set by default. The user role and permission can only be set once a user account is created in 3Scale.

To make sure you create users with the correct roles for Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform:

. Create the user using Red Hat Single Sign-On administration console.
. Make sure that user logs into the  Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform console.
. Log into the  Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console and assign the roles to that user.


=== Accessing the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

To access the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console:

. Navigate to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* URL that you received in the *Welcome* email.
If asked for credentials, login as the `customer-admin` user.

. Click the *Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform* link available in the *Applications* panel.


=== Setting user roles and permissions in Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console

.Prerequisite

* You have logged into the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform administration console.

NOTE: All users in 3Scale are created as a `member` with no permissions set by default.

To change permissions for a 3Scale user:

. Navigate to *Account Settings* by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the 3Scale console.
