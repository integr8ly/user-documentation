Congratulations,

Your {PRODUCT_SHORT} environment is now available.

You can now log into the link:{webapp-url}[{webapp}] using {username}/{password}.

You are prompted to reset your password after logging in for the first time.

The {webapp} displays links to various consoles, including the OpenShift console and offers you curated {walkthrough-name}s.

ifeval::["{PRODUCT_SHORT}"=="Integreatly"]

We have also pre-seeded the environment with 50 evaluation users.
These evaluation accounts take the form of evalsN where N represents a number between 01 and 50.
The password for each of these evaluation accounts is Password1.
